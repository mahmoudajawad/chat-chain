# `chat_chain`

Simple chain toolings to build conversational applications.

## Introduction
While tools like [`langchain`](https://langchain.com) are available, the lightspeed development cycles occurring makes adapting it for simple applications requirement not suitable.

As part of working on multiple projects to experiment with GPT models from OpenAI, like [`conversational_kb`](https://github.com/mahmoudajawad/conversational_kb) and [`whatsgpt`](https://github.com/mahmoudajawad/whatsgpt), I realised I already have all the tools to build my purpose-specific chain for conversational applications that use OpenAI GPT models.
